   # What is the project?
   * I made a guessing game with Python using Pycharm
   # How does the project work?
   * Our project consists of a test question.
 Every question you know gives you +5 points, if you get it wrong you lose one life for each question and you have no right to make mistakes, you have 3 lives in the game.
   # resources I use
   * The sources I used were Youtube, ChatGPT and W3schools.
